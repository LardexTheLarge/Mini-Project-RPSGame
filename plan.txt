logic of this game - user will select a value and 
                     the computer will select random value

how does a user win this game?

R beats S 
P beats R 
S beats P

what data do i need to track in the app??
wins, losses, ties - create variables

computer selection - how am i going to have the pc randomly choose one of these values
R, P or S 

var computerChoice = ["R" , "P", "S"]

math.floor()    math.random()

once we hav the user selection and random computer selection

we need to compare the 2 values to see if the user won, loss, or tied

if statement - if user wins-wins++

logical operatiors - && || === == ! != !==
